# UmaTools

UmaTools is a responsive Uma Musume companion suite for planning training runs, checking race requirements, exploring game data, and handling common day-to-day decisions. The tools share one navigation system, visual language, settings panel, English/Japanese localization layer, and mobile-first interface.

```

`public/` is the deployment root. Browser URLs remain `/optimizer`, `/assets/...`, `/js/...`, and so on; the repository layout does not leak into public URLs.

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for component ownership, data flow, and maintenance rules.

## Local development

Requirements:

- Node.js 20 or newer.
- Python 3 only for the API and Python-backed data utilities.
- The Vercel CLI for local parity with production routing and functions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daftuyda/UmaTools.git
cd UmaTools
npm install
npx vercel dev
```

For a static-only preview, serve the `public/` directory with any local HTTP server.

## Common commands

```bash
npm run build             # Publish documentation, validate CSS, normalize JSON, and create WebP assets
npm run build:guides      # Publish docs/guides as static documents under /guides
npm run lint              # JavaScript and Python linting
npm test                  # Rating and Team Trials tests
npm run check             # Full lint, unit, data, markup, reference, and route gate
npm run check:seo         # Verify metadata, schema, canonicals, sitemap, and internal discovery
npm run check:static      # Verify local page, asset, CSS, and service-worker references
npm run test:data         # Parse every deployed JSON dataset and manifest
npm run test:smoke        # Serve the site and verify every clean route and critical asset
npm run audit:lighthouse  # Mobile + desktop Lighthouse audit of primary tools
npm run audit:responsive  # Browser layout/runtime audit across phone, tablet, and desktop
npm run audit:ios         # Check important paths for iOS Safari compatibility
```

Set `LIGHTHOUSE_PAGES` to a comma-separated subset such as `optimizer,calculator` when iterating
locally. The audit server uses Brotli/gzip like the deployment host, while the default command still
checks every configured primary page against the performance, interactivity, and layout-shift
targets.

## Data maintenance

Runtime data lives in `public/assets/`. Game-facing URLs still begin with `/assets/`.

```bash
npm run sync:skills-all
npm run sync:uma
npm run sync:supports
npm run sync:races
npm run sync:accel-compat
npm run sync:uma-skills
npm run refresh:data
```

The scheduled workflow in `.github/workflows/gametora-scrape.yml` refreshes the core GameTora datasets. Local scrape caches are ignored and are not part of the deployable repository.

See the [data-tooling guide](scripts/data/README.md) for generator ownership, optional scraper
dependencies, and the retained browser fallback.

## Documentation

The Markdown files in `docs/guides/` are the source of truth for the public
[UmaTools documentation hub](https://daftuyda.moe/guides). Run `npm run build:guides` after editing
a document; generated HTML in `public/guides.html` and `public/guides/` should not be edited
directly.
`npm run check` verifies that the published pages and copied diagrams are current.
